Since opponents will undoubtedly attack, criticize, and blame, anyway, the advantages of being proactive, airing one’s own “dirty laundry,” and “telling on oneself” are too significant to ignore. Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed. That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around. This approach is appropriately termed “stealing thunder.” When an organization steals thunder, it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties. In experimental research by Arpan and Roskos-Ewoldsen, stealing thunder in a crisis situation, as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party, resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings. As significant, the authors found that “credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe.”\n",

        "Some psychologists believe that insight is the result of a restructuring of a problem after a period of non-progress where the person is believed to be too focused on past experience and get stuck. A new manner to represent the problem is suddenly discovered, leading to a different path to a solution heretofore unpredicted. It has been claimed that no specific knowledge, or experience is required to attain insight in the problem situation. As a matter of fact, one should break away from experience and let the mind wander freely. Nevertheless, experimental studies have shown that insight is actually the result of ordinary analytical thinking. The restructuring of a problem can be caused by unsuccessful attempts in solving the problem, leading to new information being brought in while the person is thinking. The new information can contribute to a completely different perspective in finding a solution, thus producing the Aha! Experience.\n",

        "Sensory-specific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite, or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed, with little change in the hedonics of uneaten food. As a result of sensory-specific satiety, when people consume a variety of foods, they tend to overeat. A greater variety of food leads people to eat more than they would otherwise. So, being full and feeling sated are separate matters. The recovery of appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who has consumed a large meal and is quite full, and does not require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily needs, but decides to consume additional calories after seeing the dessert cart. Small changes in the sensory properties of foods are sufficient to increase food intake. For example, subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of pasta.\n",

        "The term “biological control” has been used, at times, in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products. This has been spectacularly successful in many instances, with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies. These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems and/or pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems. On the other hand, this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems. In these situations, the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agro-ecosystem setting. Thus, importation programs, to date, are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved.\n",

When deciding whether to invest in a company, for example, they may take into account the people at the helm; the current and potential size of its market; net profits; and its past, present, and future stock value, among other pieces of information. Weighing all of these factors can take up so much of your working memory that it becomes overwhelmed. Think of having piles and piles of papers, sticky notes, and spreadsheets strewn about your desk, and you get a picture of what’s going on inside the brain. When information overloads working memory this way, it can make brokers ― and the rest of us ― scrap all the strategizing and analyses and go for emotional, or gut, decisions.\n",

In the United States, we are all familiar with the mandatory nutritional information placed on food products. The Securities and Exchange Commission that monitors American stock markets forces firms to meet certain reporting requirements before their stock can be listed on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Such reporting helps ensure that private investors have reliable information on which to base their investment decisions. Often, however, these regulations do not work adequately, as the Enron scandal in 2001 clearly illustrates. The oil trading company Enron had cooked its books to overstate its profitability in its mandated reports. One outcome of Enron’s subsequent financial collapse was the introduction of new regulations designed to improve the reliability of the information that companies must provide to the public.\n",

        "Individual authors and photographers have rights to their intellectual property during their lifetimes, and their heirs have rights for 70 years after the creator’s death, so any publication less than 125 years old has to be checked for its copyright status. The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years; the life-plus-70-years standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which increased the 50-year limit established by the 1976 Copyright Act. Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies. And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose. In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts. Therefore, the extended copyright protection frustrates new creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics on Internet sites.\n",

        "According to the individualist form of rhetoric about science, still much used for certain purposes, discoveries are made in laboratories. They are the product of inspired patience, of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind. Moreover, they speak for themselves, or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them. It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held, yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts. Any scientist who announces a so-called discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker. The norms of scientific communication presuppose that nature does not speak unambiguously, and that knowledge isn’t knowledge unless it has been authorized by disciplinary specialists. A scientific truth has little standing until it becomes a collective product. What happens in somebody’s laboratory is only one stage in its construction.\n",

        "1950s critics separated themselves from the masses by rejecting the ‘natural’ enjoyment afforded by products of mass culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism. For example, in most critics championing Douglas Sirk’s films’ social critique, self-reflexivity, and, in particular, distancing effects, there is still a refusal of the ‘vulgar’ enjoyments suspected of soap operas. This refusal again functions to divorce the critic from an image of a mindless, pleasure-seeking crowd he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively secure the righteous logic of ‘good’ taste. It also pushes negative notions of female taste and subjectivity. Critiques of mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption of the people. The process of taste-making operated, then, to create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd.\n",

        "We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change. Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world’s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD ― destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.\n",

        "In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first manuals teaching “table manners” to the offspring of aristocrats. It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione, The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa, and many others produced in different European countries. In a variety of ways and meanings, these are all instruments intended to define or distinguish who is in from who is out, separating the participants from the ostracized. It is for this reason that manuals of “good manners” addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative reference to the peasant who behaves badly, who “doesn’t know” what the rules are, and for this reason is excluded from the lordly table. Food etiquette had become a sign of social barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down.\n",

This is an important focus ― especially as more and more information becomes available electronically. However, the traditional strengths of libraries have always been their collections. This is true still today ― especially in research libraries. Also, collection makeup is the hardest thing to change quickly. For example, if a library has a long tradition of heavily collecting materials published in Mexico, then even if that library stops purchasing all Mexican imprints, its Mexican collection will still be large and impressive for several years to come unless they start withdrawing books. Likewise, if a library has not collected much in a subject, and then decides to start collecting heavily in that area it will take several years for the collection to be large enough and rich enough to be considered an important research tool.\n",

        "Human beings do not enter the world as competent moral agents. Nor does everyone leave the world in that state. But somewhere in between, most people acquire a bit of decency that qualifies them for membership in the community of moral agents. Genes, development, and learning all contribute to the process of becoming a decent human being. The interaction between nature and nurture is, however, highly complex, and developmental biologists are only just beginning to grasp just how complex it is. Without the context provided by cells, organisms, social groups, and culture, DNA is inert. Anyone who says that people are “genetically programmed” to be moral has an oversimplified view of how genes work. Genes and environment interact in ways that make it nonsensical to think that the process of moral development in children, or any other developmental process, can be discussed in terms of nature versus nurture. Developmental biologists now know that it is really both, or nature through nurture. A complete scientific explanation of moral evolution and development in the human species is a very long way off.\n",

This is a critical activity because the frame you choose strongly influences your understanding of the problem, thereby conditioning your approach to solving it. For an illustration, consider Thibodeau and Broditsky’s series of experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime in a community. They found that the respondents’ suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast. People presented with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the problem, such as eliminating poverty and improving education. On the other hand, people presented with the beast metaphor focused on remediations: increasing the size of the police force and prisons.\n",

Social and cultural influences and causes are minimized, ignored, or eliminated from consideration at all. Thoughts, original and conventional,are identified with individuals, and the special things that individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains. The “trick” here is to recognize that individual humans are social constructions themselves, embodying and reflecting the variety of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to during their lives. Our individuality is not denied, but it is viewed as a product of specific social and cultural experiences. The brain itself is a social thing, influenced structurally and at the level of its connectivities by social environments.

Interestingly, art in tribal societies is frequently abandoned after it has served its purpose. The focus is on the magical, expressive, and social value of the act of making. Some contemporary artists share this feeling, but they are also caught up in the system of art exhibition, the selling of their art, and the requirements of an art market.

Within industries, companies are always trying to develop products that are one step better than those of other companies. For those who fail to compete successfully, their very survival can be in question.\n",

        "The Ndembu people of Central Africa believe that illness is often the result of the anger of a relative, friend, or enemy towards the patient. This emotion, they say, causes a tooth to enter the body of the patient and create disease. The healer calls together the victim's relatives and friends to watch a ceremony, at the end of which he \"removes\" the tooth from the patient's throat, arm, leg, etc. Although the patient and the villagers know what has happened ― that the tooth has been hidden inside the healer's mouth the whole time, the patient is often cured.\n",

        "Have you heard the saying: \"A problem shared is a problem halved\"? If you keep your problem to yourself, it can seem a great deal worse than it really is. If you talk to somebody about your problem, you can come to see it in a different light. Putting an emotion into words and saying it out loud often helps. Also, you will sometimes find that the person you talk to can convince you that there is really nothing to worry about at all.\n",

        "This year, world grain production is likely to set historic records, permitting some rebuilding of world food stockpiles. India, once written off as a hopeless case, has almost tripled its food production in the last 30 years. Laborers in Russia expect a regular portion of meat, and Chinese peasants no longer suffer from the famines that in the past have swept over the land. Despite the real progress, however, there are still more hungry people in the world than ever before­both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total world population. The rising cost of food has contributed to this situation. By most estimates, more than 500 million people - roughly one out of every nine -suffer from serious malnutrition today, compared with 100 million to 200 million -one out of every 14 to 25 people - in the 1950's.\n",

People struggling to pay their bills can access support through payment plans or by being allowed to switch to a cheaper internet package without paying a penalty fee. But which package you can access will depend on where you live, as not all properties can receive every broadband service. Those in rural areas in particular will have limited options. There are 67Mbps broadband packages available for about Â£25 per month from some suppliers. But you should be aware the advertised costs change as companies increase their prices every spring - with the highest price hike coming in at 17.3% this April. A 100Mbps connection may sound like a lot - but you may not get that speed all of the time. BBC iPlayer and Netflix both recommend a 5Mbps connection to stream a programme in high quality. But the moment two people in a household are both streaming video, that would put the connection at capacity - and that's assuming you aren't using your phone while streaming video."
